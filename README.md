ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BPCode20

I am a Data Scientist from Vienna/Austria with a couple of years of experience. I am trying to use my GitHub Repos to showcase my projects and some technologies that i find interesting with the goal of helping someone to have an easier start using these technologies.
Also, I have some code examples that I use regularly in projects in case someone else find them useful. I am working on expanding the projects, but as always it take a lot of time.

I hope you find something interesting.

Cheers. 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in almost everything regaring data science, ML, visualization and big data processing.
